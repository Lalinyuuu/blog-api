**What to farm:**

✅ **Be honest about your level/gear**

❌ **Don't lie about gear**  
❌ **Don't join if undergeared** (ask first)  
❌ **Don't be rude**

---

### During Party:

**As Tank (Swordsman):**
\`\`\`
1. Pull monsters first
2. Face them away from party
3. Call out dangerous enemies
4. Stay alive (dead tank = dead party)
\`\`\`

**As Healer (Acolyte):**
\`\`\`

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Spreading Stats Everywhere

**Wrong:** STR 20, AGI 20, VIT 20, INT 20, DEX 20, LUK 20  
**Right:** Focus on 2-3 stats maximum

**Why:** Specialized builds >> Jack-of-all-trades

---

### ❌ Mistake #2: Buying Fashion Early

**Wrong:** Spending 500k on cute headgear  
**Right:** Spend on +7 weapon first

**Why:** Fashion doesn't help you farm. Stats do.

---

### ❌ Mistake #3: Soloing Everything

**Wrong:** "I'll just solo to 99"  
**Right:** Join parties for faster leveling

**Why:** Parties = 2-3x faster XP + social connections

---

### ❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring Elemental Advantages

**Wrong:** Using normal arrows vs everything  
**Right:** Fire arrows vs Earth monsters (+75% damage!)

**Why:** Elements are FREE damage multipliers

---

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Saving Money

**Wrong:** Spending every zeny immediately  
**Right:** Save for big upgrades (+7 weapon, key cards)

**Why:** Small purchases add up. Save for impactful buys.

## 💡 Advanced Leveling Tips

1. **Job Level matters** - Don't rush job change
2. **Switch maps** when EXP drops below 100 per kill
3. **Party composition** - 1 tank, 1 heal, rest DPS
4. **Food buffs** - Agi/Int/Str foods add up
5. **Guild buffs** - Join active guilds for +10% EXP

### Common Mistakes:
❌ Staying in low-level zones too long  
❌ Ignoring elemental advantages  
❌ Solo play when party is faster  
❌ Poor party composition  
❌ Not using buffs/food  

### Money While Leveling:
- **Loot valuable cards** (even common ones sell)

      content: `# War of Emperium: Guild Warfare Strategy

**War of Emperium (WoE)** is Ragnarok Online's ultimate PvP experience—massive guild battles where **hundreds of players** clash for control of castles. Success requires **coordination, strategy, and execution** on a scale unlike any other content.

This guide covers **guild warfare strategy**: team compositions, castle layouts, roles, and how to dominate WoE.

---

## 🏰 What is War of Emperium?

**WoE is:**
- **Guild vs Guild** battles for castle control
- **Massive scale** (20v20, 40v40, 100v100+)
- **Strategic objectives** (break Emperium to capture castle)
- **Weekly events** (usually 2-3 hours, 2-3 times per week)
- **High stakes** (castle ownership = prestige + benefits)

### Castle Benefits:

**Owning a Castle:**
- **Guild Hall** access (private guild area)
- **Castle-specific equipment** (unique items)
- **Tax collection** (zeny from castle NPCs)
- **Prestige** (guild ranking, recruitment)
- **Storage** (guild storage system)

---

## 🎯 Core WoE Strategy

### The Three Phases:

**1. Entry Phase** - Break through castle gates
**2. Push Phase** - Fight through hallways and rooms  
**3. Emperium Phase** - Destroy the Emperium to capture

**Each phase requires different tactics and team compositions.**

---

## 👥 Team Compositions & Roles

### Core Squad Roles:

| Role | Classes | Primary Job | Secondary Job |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Front Tank** | Lord Knight, Paladin | Soak damage, create space | Peel for supports |
| **Control** | High Wizard, Professor | AoE damage, crowd control | Zone control, utility |
| **Support** | High Priest | Heal, buff, resurrect | Lex Aeterna, Safety Wall |
| **Assassin** | Assassin Cross | Pick off supports | Break enemy lines |
| **Ranged DPS** | Sniper, High Wizard | Sustained damage | Zone control |
| **Breaker** | High ASPD melee | Break Emperium fast | Objective focus |

---

### Ideal Guild Composition (40-60 players):

**Tanks (8-12):**
- 6-8 Lord Knights (main tanks)
- 2-4 Paladins (support tanks)

**DPS (15-20):**
- 8-10 Assassin Cross (picks)
- 4-6 Snipers (ranged DPS)
- 3-4 High Wizards (AoE damage)

**Support (8-12):**
- 6-8 High Priests (healers)
- 2-4 Professors (utility, dispel)

**Breakers (4-6):**
- 4-6 High ASPD melee (Emperium focus)

**Leaders (2-4):**
- 2-4 experienced players (callouts, strategy)

---

## 🏰 Castle Layout Strategy

### Phase 1: Entry (Breaking Gates)

**Objective:** Break through castle gates and enter

**Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Form up outside castle
2. Wizards cast Storm Gust on gate
3. Tanks engage enemy defenders
4. Push through gate when weakened
5. Establish foothold inside
\`\`\`

**Key Skills:**
- **Storm Gust** (Wizard) - AoE damage to gate
- **Bowling Bash** (Knight) - AoE damage
- **Safety Wall** (Priest) - Protect breakers

**Common Mistakes:**
- Rushing in without coordination
- Not clearing enemy defenders first
- Ignoring gate HP (some gates are very strong)

---

### Phase 2: Push (Hallways & Rooms)

**Objective:** Fight through castle interior to Emperium room

**Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Clear each room systematically
2. Use chokepoints to your advantage
3. Control enemy respawn points
4. Push as a coordinated unit
5. Don't overextend
\`\`\`

**Key Tactics:**

**Chokepoint Control:**
- **Land Protector** (Professor) blocks enemy AoE
- **Safety Wall** (Priest) protects key positions
- **Storm Gust** (Wizard) zones enemy movement

**Line Breaking:**
- **Assassin Cross** flanks and picks supports
- **Bowling Bash** (Knight) creates gaps
- **Focus fire** on isolated enemies

**Respawn Control:**
- **Camp enemy respawn points**
- **Prevent enemy regrouping**
- **Maintain numerical advantage**

---

### Phase 3: Emperium (Final Objective)

**Objective:** Destroy the Emperium to capture castle

**Strategy:**
\`\`\`
1. Secure Emperium room
2. Protect your breakers
3. Prevent enemy from entering
4. Maximize ASPD on Emperium
5. Defend until capture complete
\`\`\`

**Emperium Mechanics:**
- **High HP** (varies by server, usually 1M-10M)
- **Only melee attacks** can damage it
- **ASPD matters** (faster attacks = faster break)
- **Defenders can repair** (if they reach it)

**Breaker Setup:**
- **High ASPD melee** (Knight, Assassin)
- **AGI food buffs** (increases ASPD)
- **Blessing** (Priest buff)
- **Concentration** (AGI buff)

**Protection:**
- **Safety Wall** around Emperium
- **Land Protector** blocks enemy AoE
- **Tanks** engage enemy breakers
- **DPS** focus enemy supports

      content: `# Arena PvP Strategies: Small-Scale Domination

**Arena PvP** is Ragnarok's fast-paced, tactical combat mode. Unlike massive War of Emperium battles, Arena focuses on **small-scale fights** (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) where **individual skill**, **team coordination**, and **burst timing** determine victory.

This guide covers team compositions, strategies, burst windows, and how to dominate Arena PvP.

## 🎯 Arena vs WoE: Key Differences

| Feature | Arena PvP | War of Emperium (WoE) |

| **Team Size** | 2v2, 3v3, 5v5 | 20v20, 40v40+ |
| **Duration** | 3-10 minutes | 1-2 hours |
| **Objective** | Kill enemy team | Break Emperium |
| **Strategy** | Focus fire, burst | Objective control, zerg |
| **Respawn** | Limited/None | Unlimited |
| **Skill Focus** | 1v1 dueling + combos | Mass AoE + Crowd control |

## 💡 Pro Tips & Common Mistakes

### ✅ DO:

1. **Focus Fire** - Call target, everyone bursts
2. **Protect Priest** - Dead Priest = loss
3. **Use CC chains** - Stack crowd control
4. **Call Lex Aeterna** - Team must know when to burst
5. **Positioning** - Priest behind, DPS flanks
6. **Use terrain** - Walls block line of sight
7. **Bring consumables** - Ygg Berries, potions, gems
8. **Practice combos** - Muscle memory wins fights

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't trickle in** - Wait for team, engage together
2. **Don't ignore Priest** - Kill supports first
3. **Don't stand clumped** - AoE will wipe you
4. **Don't waste burst** - Wait for CC before nuking
5. **Don't chase** - Reset and re-engage properly
6. **Don't forget Marc** - Freeze = death
7. **Don't tunnel vision** - Be aware of flanks

**Requirement:** Kill enemy Priest instantly  
**Success:** 70% if executed well

**Strategy:** Outlast resources  
**Requirement:** Double Priest comp  
**Success:** 90% if patient

\`\`\`
Good Positioning + CC Chains + Focus Fire + Burst Timing = Arena Domination
\`\`\`

**Remember:**
- **Kill Priest first** - No heals = enemy team collapses

## 📋 MVP Hunting Procedure

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Before You Hunt:**
1. **Check timers** - Is MVP in spawn window?
2. **Form party** - Get all roles
3. **Buff up** - AGI/Bless/Food buffs
4. **Stock consumables** - Potions, berries, arrows
5. **Assign roles** - Everyone knows their job
6. **Communication check** - Discord/in-game chat ready

---

### Phase 2: Scouting

**Scout Process:**
\`\`\`
1. Scout enters MVP map
2. Use Sight/Falcon to detect MVP
3. Check for enemy guilds
4. Call out location:
   "Eddga up at (234, 156), clear"
5. Party moves in
\`\`\`

**If Contested:**
- Assess enemy strength
- Decide: Fight for MVP or skip
- Don't start fights you can't win

---

### Phase 3: Clear Adds

**CRITICAL STEP:**
- Kill all nearby mobs before engaging MVP
- Adds + MVP = party wipe
- Assign 1-2 DPS to clear
- Don't start MVP until map is clear

---

### Phase 4: Pull & Kill

**Pull Sequence:**
\`\`\`
1. Tank Provokes MVP
2. Tank positions MVP (face away from party)
3. Priest buffs tank (Kyrie/SW)
4. DPS starts damage
5. Tank calls out mechanics:
   "AoE incoming!"
   "Meteor Storm, spread out!"
   "30% HP, burn phase!"
6. Priest heals constantly
7. DPS finishes MVP
\`\`\`

---

### Phase 5: Loot Distribution

**Loot Rules (Establish Before Hunting):**

**Option A: Need/Greed Rolls**
- MVP loot window pops
- Players roll (1-100)
- Highest roll wins
- Fair but slow

**Option B: Round-Robin**
- Loot rotates to next player
- Track who got last MVP card
- Fair over time

**Option C: Guild Bank**
- All loot goes to guild
- Sold and split evenly
- Best for organized guilds

**Option D: FFA (Free-for-All)**
- First to loot wins
- Fastest clicker gets reward
- Causes drama, not recommended

**Pro Tip:** **Establish rules BEFORE starting!** Loot drama kills guilds.

**Solo MVP hunting** is the ultimate test of skill, gear, and patience. When you drop that boss alone, **the loot is all yours**—but so is the risk. Not all MVPs are soloable, but many are with the right build, discipline, and knowledge.

This guide covers **practical solo archetypes**, survival patterns, and which MVPs you can realistically take down solo.

---

## 🎯 What Makes an MVP Soloable?

### Key Factors:

1. **Survivability** - Can you tank or avoid the boss's damage?
2. **Sustain** - Can you outlast the fight (potions, SP, HP)?
3. **DPS** - Can you kill it before running out of resources?
4. **Mechanics Knowledge** - Do you know the boss's patterns?
5. **Escape Plan** - Can you teleport/run if things go wrong?

### MVP Difficulty Tiers:

**Tier 1 (Soloable by Most Classes):**
- Orc Hero
- Orc Lord
- Goblin Leader
- Drake

**Tier 2 (Requires Specific Builds):**
- Eddga
- Phreeoni
- Moonlight Flower
- Maya

**Tier 3 (Hard, Needs Perfect Gear):**
- Doppelganger

- Baphomet

**Tier 4 (Party Recommended):**
- Thanatos
- Valkyrie Randgris
- Beelzebub
- Satan Morroc

## 💡 Pro Tips for Solo MVP Hunting

### ✅ DO:

1. **Know the MVP spawn time** (1-4 hours respawn)
2. **Scout first** - Don't engage if contested
3. **Clear minions** - Adds will kill you
4. **Set up hotkeys** - Potions, skills, emergency items

8. **Record kills** - Learn patterns for next time

### ❌ DON'T:

2. **Don't fight without full potions** (you WILL run out)
3. **Don't tank without Marc** (freeze = death)
4. **Don't chase steal** - If someone KSes, let it go
5. **Don't fight MVP + adds** - Clear first
6. **Don't underestimate** - Even "easy" MVPs can kill you

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Solo MVP hunting is:**
- ✅ **Profitable** - All loot is yours
- ✅ **Challenging** - True end-game content
- ✅ **Rewarding** - Pride + loot
- ⚠️ **Time-consuming** - Respawn timers
- ⚠️ **Contested** - Other players compete

**Rule #1:** **Know the boss script.** If you can predict, you can live.

**Rule #2:** **Patience beats impatience.** Wait for the right moment.

**Rule #3:** **Solo doesn't mean alone.** Join an MVP hunting guild for spawn tracking!

**Most Important:** Start with easy MVPs (Orc Hero, Drake) and work your way up. Don't rush into Dark Lord solo on day 1! 💀

      content: `# Crafting & Refining: Maximizing Equipment Value

**Refining is exciting—and expensive.** One successful +10 can transform your character. One failed +8 can bankrupt you. This guide teaches you a **value-first approach**: maximize returns while minimizing risk.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Safe refines first** (+0 to +4 = almost free)
2. **Cards before refines** (better ROI)
3. **Elements beat refines** (30-75% damage boost)
4. **Weapon > Armor** (damage matters most)
5. **Know when to stop** (+7 is the sweet spot for most players)
6. **Never gamble what you can't replace**

---

## ⚙️ Understanding the Refining System

### How Refining Works:

**Refining** adds stats to equipment using **Elunium** (Lv 1-2 weapons/armor) or **Oridecon** (Lv 3-4 weapons/armor) plus **Phracon/Emveretarcon** for lower levels.

### Refine Bonuses:

**Weapons:**
- **Each +1:** +ATK (varies by weapon level)
  - Lv 1 weapons: +2 ATK per refine
  - Lv 2 weapons: +3 ATK per refine
  - Lv 3 weapons: +5 ATK per refine
  - Lv 4 weapons: +7 ATK per refine

**Armor:**
- **Each +1:** +DEF (uniform bonus)
  - All armor: +1 DEF per refine

### Success Rates:

| Refine Level | Success Rate | Material | Cost Estimate |
|--------------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| +0 → +4 | **100%** (Safe) | Phracon/Emveretarcon | ~5-10k total |
| +4 → +5 | ~60% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |
| +5 → +6 | ~50% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |
| +6 → +7 | ~40% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |
| +7 → +8 | ~30% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |
| +8 → +9 | ~20% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |
| +9 → +10 | ~10% | Elunium/Oridecon | ~50-100k |

**Warning:** Failed refines **downgrade** the item by 1 level (not destroyed until +0).

---

## 🛡️ Safe Refining Zone (+0 to +4)

### Why This Is Free Money:

**100% success rate** = No risk!

### What to Refine to +4:

✅ **Everything you use regularly:**
- Main weapon
- Armor
- Shield
- Garment
- Shoes
- All accessories

### Materials Needed:

**Level 1 Equipment:**
- 4x Phracon (~1-2k each)
- **Total:** ~4-8k per item

**Level 2 Equipment:**
- 4x Emveretarcon (~2-3k each)
- **Total:** ~8-12k per item

**Level 3-4 Equipment:**
- 4x Elunium (Lv 3) or 4x Oridecon (Lv 4) (~10-20k each)
- **Total:** ~40-80k per item

### Where to Refine:

**NPCs in major cities:**
- **Prontera:** South-west building
- **Morocc:** Weapon shop area
- **Payon:** North-west corner
- **Geffen:** Near fountain

### Pro Tip:
Always refine to +4 **BEFORE** inserting expensive cards. If you break the item later, you lose the cards too!

---

## ⚔️ Value Refining Zone (+4 to +7)

### The Sweet Spot:

**+7** is where **80% of players should stop**. Here's why:

**Benefits:**
- Significant stat boost (weapon +7 = +21-49 ATK depending on level)
- Still achievable on reasonable budget (~2-5M per item)
- Decent success rates (40% at +6→+7)

**Costs:**
- **Expected cost to +7:** ~3-8M (depends on luck)
- **Time:** Few hours of attempts

### Priority Order:

**1. Main Weapon (+7) - TOP PRIORITY**
- Biggest damage increase
- Affects all your farming efficiency
- ROI: Every +1 = ~3-7 ATK = faster kills

**2. Armor (+5-7)**
- +5 = budget-friendly
- +7 = min-maxing

**3. Shield (+5-7)**
- Only for tanks/melee
- Lower priority

**4. Other Equipment (+4-5)**
- Garment, Shoes, Accessories
- Usually not worth beyond +5

---

### Refining Strategy for +7 Weapon:

**Method 1: Buy Pre-Refined**
- Check market for +7 weapons
- Often cheaper than refining yourself
- **Pros:** No gambling, instant
- **Cons:** Less satisfying

**Method 2: Refine Yourself**
- Buy multiple copies of the same weapon
- Refine them all to +4 (safe)
- Push them to +5, +6, +7 one by one
- Sell failed ones at lower refine

**Example Budget:**
\`\`\`
Item: Composite Bow [4]
Base cost: 300k

Attempt 1: +4 → +7
- Success at +7: DONE! (Lucky)
- Cost: ~500k in materials

Attempt 2 (if failed):
- +4 → +5 (success)
- +5 → +6 (success)
- +6 → +7 (FAIL, now +5)
- Sell +5 bow: ~350k
- Net loss: 450k

Average attempts to +7: 3-5
Total expected cost: 2-4M
\`\`\`

---

## 🔥 Dangerous Zone (+7 to +10)

### Why This Is Risky:

**Low success rates + High costs = Bankruptcy potential**

| Target | Success Rate | Expected Cost | When Worth It |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| +8 | 30% | 5-15M | End-game DPS |
| +9 | 20% | 15-50M | Whales only |
| +10 | 10% | 50-200M+ | Show-offs |

### When to Push Past +7:

✅ **You SHOULD consider +8-10 if:**
- You have 10M+ disposable income
- Your main weapon is already +7 and carded
- You're min-maxing for MVP/WoE
- You can afford to lose the investment

❌ **You should NOT push past +7 if:**
- It's your only weapon
- You need the money for cards
- You're still building your character
- You're not in end-game content

---

### The +10 Gamble:

**Case Study: +7 to +10 Composite Bow [4]**

\`\`\`
Starting point: +7 Composite Bow (3M invested)
Goal: +10
Success rate: 10% at +9→+10

Scenario 1: Success (10% chance)
- Attempts: 15-20 tries
- Cost: 80-150M in materials + broken items
- Result: +10 bow (prestige, +20% more damage)

Scenario 2: Failure (90% chance)
- Attempts: Countless
- Cost: 100M+ wasted
- Result: Bankruptcy, ragequit

ROI: Usually NEGATIVE unless you're farming MVPs 24/7
\`\`\`

**Verdict:** Only go for +10 if you're rich or insane. Often both.

---

## 💎 Cards vs Refines: The Math

### Which Is Better?

**Example: Hunter with Composite Bow**

**Option A: +7 Bow [4] with 4x Skeleton Worker**
- Cost: 3M bow + 2M cards = **5M total**
- Damage boost: +35 ATK (refines) + 60% size bonus = **~180% total DPS**

**Option B: +10 Bow [4] with no cards**
- Cost: 80M+ in refining
- Damage boost: +56 ATK = **~140% total DPS**

**Option C: +7 Bow [4] with 4x Skeleton Worker (BEST)**
- Cost: 5M total
- Damage: **~180% DPS at 1/16th the cost**

**Winner:** **Cards > Refines** for 90% of players!

---

### Priority Investment Path:

1. **+4 everything** (~100k)
2. **Buy essential cards** (Marc, Raydric, weapon cards) (~5-10M)
3. **+7 main weapon** (~3-5M)
4. **+5 armor** (~1-2M)
5. **Upgrade cards** (better weapon cards) (~5-10M)
6. **+7 armor** (~3-5M)
7. **Consider +8 weapon** (if rich)
8. **Never +10 unless you're a whale**

---

## 🌟 High-Refine Equipment (HD Ori/Elu)

### Special Refining Materials:

**HD Elunium / HD Oridecon:**
- **What:** Higher success rate materials
- **Where:** Rare drops, events, cash shop
- **Success Rate:** +10-20% better than normal
- **Cost:** 5-10x more expensive than normal

**Worth It?**
- For +8-10 attempts: YES (if you're going for it anyway)
- For +4-7 attempts: NO (waste of money)

---

## 🎲 Shadow Refining & Breaking

### Shadow Equipment (Post-Renewal):

Some servers have **Shadow Equipment** which:
- Can be refined safely to +9
- Breaking drops to +0 but doesn't destroy
- Cheaper refining costs

**Check your server mechanics!**

---

### Breaking Mechanics:

**What happens when refining fails?**
- **+4 and below:** Can't fail
- **+5 to +10:** Drops by 1 level
- **+0:** Item is **destroyed** (RIP)

**Protection Methods:**
- Some servers: **Refine Tickets** (cash shop)
- Some servers: **HD materials** reduce break chance
- **Never refine without backup plans**

---

## ⚒️ Crafting vs Buying

### When to Craft:

**Craftable Weapons/Armor:**
- Some end-game gear requires crafting (e.g., Damascus, Elven Bow)
- **Materials:** Gathered from monsters
- **NPC:** Forgers in major cities

✅ **Craft if:**
- Materials are cheap
- You enjoy the process
- Item is untradeable

❌ **Buy if:**
- Time = money for you
- Market price < material cost
- You want it NOW

---

### Slotting Equipment:

**Some weapons/armor can add slots:**
- **Very Rare Slotted Variants** drop from MVPs
- **Slot Enchanting** (server dependent)
- **Cost:** Usually 10M+ for slot addition

**Priority:**
1. Get slotted version first (buy or farm)
2. THEN refine
3. THEN insert cards

**Never refine slotless gear hoping to add slots later!**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips & Warnings

### ✅ DO:

1. **Always refine to +4 first** (it's free!)
2. **Buy cards before pushing past +7**
3. **Use elemental arrows/converters** (better than refines)
4. **Shop for pre-refined gear** (often cheaper)
5. **Have backup weapons** (never gamble your only one)
6. **Refine during events** (some servers boost rates)
7. **Watch market prices** (materials fluctuate)

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't refine past +7 if it's your only weapon**
2. **Don't insert cards before refining to +4**
3. **Don't chase +10 unless you're rich**
4. **Don't refine armor before weapon**
5. **Don't believe "lucky spots" or "lucky NPCs"** (it's RNG)
6. **Don't refine when tilted** (gambling addiction is real)
7. **Don't forget: Elements > Refines** for damage

## 📚 Common Questions

**Q: Should I refine before or after adding cards?**  
A: **After +4 refining, before +5+.** Reason: If you break at +5-7, you only lose refines, not cards.

**Q: What if I fail a +7 refine?**  
A: Item drops to +6. Try again or sell it and buy a new one.

**Q: Is +10 worth it?**  
A: **Only for ultra-rich end-game players.** For 99% of players, +7 is perfect.

**Q: Can I use HD materials for +4?**  
A: **No.** It's 100% success anyway. Save HD materials for +8-10 attempts.

**Q: Should I refine armor or weapon first?**  
A: **Weapon.** More damage = faster farming = more money = afford armor later.

**Q: Does element beat refines?**  
A: **YES!** Fire arrows vs Earth mobs = +75% damage. That's like +15 refine levels!

## 🎉 Conclusion

**The Golden Rules of Refining:**

1. 🥇 **+4 everything** = Free stats
2. 🥈 **Cards > Refines** = Better ROI
3. 🥉 **+7 weapon** = Sweet spot
4. 🏅 **+7 armor** = Good enough
5. 🎯 **Elements > Refines** = Smart play

**Remember:**
- **Refining is gambling.** Set limits and stick to them.
- **Cards are permanent.** Refines can be lost.
- **+7 is the goal** for 90% of players.
- **+10 is a luxury**, not a necessity.

**Most Important:** A well-carded +7 set beats a poorly-carded +10 set. Focus on the fundamentals! 💪`,

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

1. **Start with survival** (Armor/Garment first)
2. **Then add damage** (Weapon cards)
3. **Optimize last** (Accessories/Shoes)
4. **Farm what you need** - Don't chase MVP cards early
5. **Role matters** - Tank ≠ DPS ≠ Support priorities

## 💡 Pro Tips & Common Mistakes

### ✅ DO:
- **Farm your own cards** when possible (Hydra = 2 hours farming)
- **Buy during events** when card prices crash
- **Prioritize survival** over damage (dead DPS = 0 DPS)
- **Match cards to your farming spot** (element/race specific)
- **Check market trends** - Some cards fluctuate wildly

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't buy MVP cards early (bad ROI)
- Don't use Deviling without knowing what you're doing
- Don't neglect Marc card (freeze = death)
- Don't over-card (4x Hydra when you farm Undead = useless)
- Don't buy cards for content you don't do

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Card Priority Summary:**
1. 🥇 Survival (Marc, Raydric) → Stay alive
2. 🥈 Damage (Weapon cards) → Kill faster
3. 🥉 Utility (Zerom, Matyr) → QoL improvements
4. 🏅 Luxury (Headgear, MVP cards) → Min-maxing
